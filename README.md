HOW TO RUN THE CODE
===================

Software Requirements:

 - Python (version >= 3.6)
 - NumPy library (used for vectorized calculations)

All code is well commented/documented, so it should not be difficult to
understand the implementations.


1. Linear Regression
--------------------

Run the following command in the terminal:

    $ python3 linear_regression.py

Expected output: It will fit and evaluate the polynomial fit model of orders 1,
2, 3, 4 on the given dataset.


2. Logistic Regression
----------------------

Run the following command in the terminal:

    $ python3 logistic_regression.py

Expected output: It will print the probability for the 4 test samples to belong
to class 1 (Man).


3. Linear Discriminant Analysis
-------------------------------

Run the following command in the terminal:

    $ python3 linear_discriminant_analysis.py

Expected output: It will print the most likely class label for the 4 test data
points, where 1 is Man and 0 is Woman.
